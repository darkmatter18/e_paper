"""Base widget interface for e-paper display.

This module provides the abstract base class and data structures for all display widgets
in the e-paper clock system. Widgets are modular components that render specific content
(clock, date, weather, quote) within defined rectangular regions of the 800x480 display.

Key Concepts:
    - Dual-channel rendering: Widgets draw to separate black and red image buffers
    - Hardware constraints: Red pigment requires full refresh; partial refresh is black-only
    - Region-based layout: Each widget owns a WidgetRegion defining its drawing area
    - Decorative separation: Content drawing is separated from decorative elements

Typical Usage:
    class MyWidget(Widget):
        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__(WidgetRegion(x=0, y=0, width=400, height=240))

        def draw(self, black_draw, red_draw=None, **kwargs):
            # Draw content
            pass

class Widget(ABC):
    """Abstract base class for all display widgets.

    Widgets are self-contained components that render content within a defined region
    of the e-paper display. They handle both full refresh (with red channel) and
    partial refresh (black-only) rendering strategies.

    Hardware Considerations:
        - Waveshare 7.5" B/V2 display has 3 colors: Black, White, Red
        - Red pigment activation requires full (flashing) refresh
        - Partial refresh can only update black pixels (red remains unchanged)
        - Widgets that need red accents should render them only when red_draw is provided

    Attributes:
        region: The WidgetRegion defining this widget's drawing area.

    Subclass Responsibilities:
        - Implement draw() to render widget content
        - Optionally override draw_decorations() for black decorative elements
        - Optionally override draw_red_decorations() for red decorative elements
        - Set supports_partial_refresh property if widget can use partial refresh
